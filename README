Show Div By ID With URL Trigger

USAGE

1. Include script.js before the closing </body> tag.
2. Add elements with ids like show1, show2, etc. Set them to display:none;.
3. Manipulate the URL query string to show the content.

Examples:

 - VALID: https://www.example.com/?show1
 - VALID: https://www.example.com/?show2
 - VALID: https://www.example.com/?show1&show2
 - INVALID: https://www.example.com/?show12 (unless you have defined show12 as a separate id to show)

You can combine multiple ids by chaining them in the query string.
